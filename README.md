# The Espresso Room Coffee Shop Sales Analysis
## Overview
Most people in this world love coffee, and as a coffee lover, I cannot think of my day without coffee on my table. That discernible bitterness can give me joy and excitement and keep me alert. Now here, as a Business Data Analyst practicing data analysis in sales, we have done this project for a coffee shop named “The Espresso Room”. This beverage chain is available in three locations. This project has unveiled some useful sales insights that could help the owners understand the market behavior, identify its trends and patterns, finding the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) that help “The Espresso Room” Coffee Shop business to unlock potential growth opportunities through the data-driven insights.

## Why this project is important?
Knowing the sales trends and understanding the market behavior are critical information for any business. Selling foods and beverages without knowing the customer’s level of satisfaction and interest will lead the business to proceed without any navigation toward growth prospects blindly. The following are the project objectives.
1.	Sales over time – This helps to find the number of beverages sold and revenue generated over a specific period (day/month).
2.	Buying trends – This explains the sales of the beverages over time and lets us know the most and least sold items to understand the customer needs and preferences
3.	Customer demographics – This visualizes the items sold in every location and helps us to identify the customer’s most and least preferred beverage at different times of the day.
Through this project, the business owners can understand the key factors contributing to the business. Also, this can show the business about the customer demographics, their needs and preferences, and their buying trends, which could help them build likeability among their customers. This project predominantly covers the DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS side of the coffee shop business.

## Data Profiling
Data profiling helps us to fix incorrect, incomplete, and duplicate data by identifying the data errors and modifying them by replacing, removing, or updating them with the relevant data. This helps to improve the data quality.
Here, in this dataset, almost all the fields have cleaned records. However, we have some fields that can be profiled further to increase the quality of the data.
1.	Convert the unit price number format into currency “USD”
2.	Create a new column, “revenue,” by multiplying transaction_qty and unit_price
3.	Create new columns to calculate “transaction_month” and “transaction_day” in text format from transaction_date
4.	Create a new column to calculate “transaction_hour” from transaction_time
5.	Create a new column right to “unit_price” to categorize the unit prize as “Low,” “Medium,” and “High” and name it as “price_category”
As we have done some data profiling, now the sales data is improvised further for manipulation.

## Project Learnings
### Product Performance
The coffee shop offers 80 unique products, with coffee being the top-selling category, contributing 39.17% of total sales. Brewed chai tea is the most frequently purchased product type, followed closely by gourmet brewed coffee and barista espresso. This indicates a strong customer preference for both traditional and specialty coffee drinks.

### Pricing Strategy
The average unit price across product categories ranges from $0.80 to $21.02, with coffee having the highest average price. The pricing structure is segmented into low ($0.80-$3.75), medium ($4.00-$9.50), and high ($10.00-$45.00) categories. This diverse pricing strategy caters to different customer segments and price sensitivities.

### Revenue Patterns
The coffee shop generates the most revenue in June, with Monday at 10 AM being the peak time for sales. Conversely, February, Saturday, and 8 PM show the lowest revenue generation. This suggests a strong weekday morning rush and potential for improvement in weekend and evening sales.

### Store Performance
Hell's Kitchen is the highest revenue-generating location, followed closely by Astoria and Lower Manhattan. All stores show an average month-over-month sales growth of 16.27%, indicating positive overall performance.

### Customer Behavior
There's a noticeable trend in customer purchasing patterns, with beverage and food sales peaking at the beginning and end of each month. Interestingly, when customers buy coffee beans, there's a decrease in beverage demand.

## Predictions and Recommendations to Increase Sales
1.	Expand specialty coffee offerings: Given the popularity of brewed chai tea and specialty coffees, introducing new flavors or limited-time offerings could drive sales and attract new customers.
2.	Optimize pricing strategy: Implement dynamic pricing for high-demand products during peak hours to maximize revenue potential.
3.	Enhance weekend and evening promotions: Develop targeted marketing campaigns and special offers to boost sales during slower periods, particularly on weekends and evenings.
4.	Introduce combo deals: Create attractive food and beverage combinations to increase average transaction value, especially during mid-month periods when sales tend to dip.
5.	Seasonal menu items: Capitalize on the strong June performance by introducing summer-themed products and promotions.
6.	Coffee bean upselling: Develop strategies to maintain beverage sales when customers purchase coffee beans, such as offering discounted drinks with bean purchases.
7.	Store-specific strategies: Tailor marketing and product offerings to each store's unique customer base and busiest days. For example, focus on Thursday promotions in Astoria and Friday specials in Hell's Kitchen.
8.	Expand high-revenue products: Promote top-selling items like Dark chocolate large and sustainably grown organic large across all locations to boost overall revenue.
9.	Time-based promotions: Implement flash sales or happy hour specials during slower hours to drive foot traffic and increase sales during typically quiet periods.
